# Flint Emails

A repository collecting, transcribing, and maybe parsing the publicly-released emails in the Flint water scandal.

Since the PDFs are so large (up to 400+MB in size), this is a good chance to test out Github's support of [Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/), which I initiated with:

        $ git lfs track "*.pdf"

### Current status

- All known documents listed in [docs.yaml](docs.yaml)
- All known documents downloaded to [docs/originals](docs/originals)
